# Summer-17-C0-compiler
This was an attempt to write a compiler in C in the summer after my freshman year. The lexer is complete. The logic for building FIRST and NEXT sets for the non-terminals is also there. That's it. Note the lexer and the parser are general-purpose, then instantiated for C0 grammer.
